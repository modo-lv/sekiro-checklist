# Roadmap {#:id,early_game,mid-game,late_game,endgame}

Time in Sekiro advances every time you acquire an item required by the main storyline. Based on this and certain events in the game that change the world, I have split the game into three parts for this guide. This is the sequence that the guide follows, each of the key items advancing time when acquired:

- ###### Early game
  1. Complete the prologue in [Ashina Reservoir].
  2. Make your way to and up the [Ashina Castle], including a detour to [Hirata Estate] and revisiting [Ashina Reservoir].
  3. Get the [Lotus of the Palace] in the [Sunken Valley] ([Bodhisattva Valley]).
  4. Get the [Mortal Blade] in the [Senpou Temple].
  5. Get the [Shelter Stone] in the [Ashina Depths] ([Mibu Village]).
  
  Acquiring all three triggers world changes in [Ashina Castle], marking the start of the mid-game.
- ###### Mid-game
  1. Revisit bodies of water and explore underwater, including picking up [Holy Chapter: Infested].*
  2. Get [Rice for Kuro] for [unlocking the Return ending](return) in [Senpou Temple].
  3. Make your way to the top of the [Ashina Castle] again.
  2. Get [Holy Chapter: Dragon's Return] for [unlocking the Return ending](return_2) in [Senpou Temple].
  4. Acquire the [Fresh Serpent Viscera] in the [Senpou Temple] ([Sunken Valley Cavern]).*
  5. Acquire the [Dried Serpent Viscera] at the [bottom of the Sunken Valley (Bodhisattva Valley)](sunken_mid).*
  6. Acquire the [Aromatic Branch] in an alternate version of [Hirata Estate].*
  7. Acquire the [Divine Dragon's Tears] in the [Fountainhead Palace].
     This triggers further world changes in [Ashina Castle], [Ashina Reservoir] and [Ashina Outskirts], marking the start of the endgame.

  \* Optional, does not advance time, but required for the Return [ending].
- ###### Endgame
  There are no more plot items to collect, just areas and bosses to get through.
  1. Get through [Ashina Castle] for the third time.
  2. Revisit [Ashina Outskirts] for optional bosses.
  3. Finish the game in [Ashina Reservoir].
